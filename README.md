This is a mod for the game Escape The Pacific by Gamers4Gamers Team. You can get it here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/655290/Escape_The_Pacific/

#### What it does

Lets you move and attach extra things to rafts.

* Fish traps
* Anything that snaps to terrain level (except sundials). Composters, big planters, water collectors etc.

## !! Warning !!
This mod **will** affect your save file, due to the way rafts are saved. Saving a raft with items attached by this mod and loading the save without the mod, **will** cause weird behaviour and break things.

* You should backup your saves before using this mod.
* Before playing without it you should detach the not-usually-attachable items and save again.

#### Save file backup

* Saves are located at C:\Users\\\<Username>\AppData\LocalLow\Gamers4Gamers Team\Escape The Pacific\SavesDir
* Make a copy of the folder, either to another location or as a new folder name in the same place
* If sharing the save, zip the folder for easier transfer

#### Installation

* Unzip it into the game folder, next to EscapeThePacific.exe. Find it via Steam by right clicking the game > Manage > Browse local files
